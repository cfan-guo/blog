Time for another WordArt Wonder! This time, it's for a week-long trip to Las Vegas. It's my first trip longer than a weekend since I went to PEI last year, ([packing list](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/x6nlh1/10_day_frugal_packing_list_for_pei_canada/)). I made a couple of changes this trip since it's 1. shorter 2. hotter 3. we're not doing anything too diverse (i.e. no hiking, gym or beaches), 4. I'm in between jobs right now, but I need to find something ASAP, so I have my laptop with me and 5. I learned a lot about myself the last trip, so I'm packing accordingly.

A little background about me and my setup - we stayed in the same hotel for the 8 days of our trip - 2 transport days plus 6 full sightseeing days. We don't really drink or gamble, but we love to eat, so we're hitting up some buffets and I'm getting my fill of American foods. I love museums, so we'll do a few museums and interactive stuff and pick up a few souvenirs. In contrast to last year's mostly athleisure attire, this year I've been trying out more natural fibres (mostly linen blends), which I'm hoping will work better in the heat and with handwashing and hopefully not stink like polyester. I'm not fussy with hair, skincare or makeup while travelling, with the exception of my brows. I usually onebag (or 1.5bag) it on the way to my destination and twobag it on the way home, but this time I was able to matryoshka doll some of my packing (I'll go in more detail in the relevant sections below but the tldr is small cube in medium cube and small bag in main bag).

## The visual packing list

{{< gslides src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSKFh44GVqkgMIQJckwlxsrxNi-2Fy5rhS907IGrgSB-8gVNsWLkrwOStpEmf5q3AZiK9d_M0qJv-iO/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000" >}}

## The bag(s)
I swapped out last year's 34L Jansport Big Student for an equally bright, but slightly lighter and smaller [Eddie Bauer Stowaway Packable 30L Backpack](https://www.eddiebauer.ca/p/82300073/stowaway-packable-30l-backpack). It's still a top loading bag, but I use packing cubes anyway so it's fine. I like it because it's 1. cheap 2. lots of colour options 3. not too heavy and 4. doesn't have too many pockets. Last year, I used this as my packable daybag and for bringing home souvenirs, but discovered that I hated wearing a bag on the front and the back (weight and maneuverability were bad). Also, I didn't find all the pockets on the Jansport useful since I mostly used just the main compartment, and it was just extra weight and features I didn't need. The one downside is that this bag has an internal laptop pocket which wouldn't usually be a problem for me, but does make going thru security a bit more stressful. I will probably stick with this bag going forwards unless I need to bring my laptop again, which I hopefully won't.

I also swapped out my Uniqlo single strap backpack for one of their (TikTok famous) [round mini shoulder bags](https://www.uniqlo.com/ca/en/products/E461053-000?colorCode=COL09). There are definitely tradeoffs - I loved the organization that last year's bag provided, but the fabric was so abrasive that it caused pilling on some of my shirts underneath. This bag is a different fabric and won't cause pilling, but it only has two internal pockets, so I've had to be strategic with how I pack it. It still doubles as the tech and liquids pouch - last year's trip I didn't bother with a separate liquids bag, but this trip I needed sunscreen.

Due to some efficiencies with packing, I was able to stuff my shoulder bag into the main bag, so technically it's onebagging on the way over! I did take the shoulder bag out when on the plane since that meant I could keep important stuff like my powerbank and painkillers on me while the main bag went into the overhead.

## The travel outfit

Following the principles of "bulkiest items worn" and also because Canada is much colder than Vegas, the travel fit entails:
- [Uniqlo Pocketable UV Protecion Parka](https://www.uniqlo.com/ca/en/products/E444550-000?colorCode=COL25&sizeCode=SMA002) (**Kept from last year**) is from the men's section, and I have it in a nice oversized XXL. I prefer this over the Airism ones I have due to its zipper pockets and more lightweight, easy to dry material. I will be wearing this pretty much every day of this trip because I hate applying sunscreen and wearing this means I don't have to worry about if I got my back or if I end up with a tiny square tan on my shoulder again.
- [Nepoagym MOTION Tank Top Bra](https://www.nepoagymwomen.com/products/motion-racerback-tank-top-bra-naked-feel) (**new**) has a built-in bra and cropped look which goes with my mostly high-waisted bottoms collection. Picked this over some of my other longline bra/ cropped tank tops I packed last year for the colour.
- [Christina B. Linen Blend Pants](https://shopsmartcanada.com/products/cristina-b-women-s-linen-pant?variant=43102936465559) (**new**) are no longer available on Costco unfortunately (link is to some website called "Shop Smart Canada" which was the only result I could find). I like it because it's linen, it's long so I don't have to worry about my thighs sticking to a seat or getting chafed to bits by those scratchy transit seats, and it looks nice. I'm personally not a fan of wide-legged pants and would've preferred a tapered fit, since wide-legged anything seems to have a tendency to get stepped on by other people or caught on things, and I still have wartime flashbacks to my flared jeans getting soaked in the winter or getting shoved into the tops of boots and causing awful calf chafing... BUT wide-legged = more breezy and I'll need all the breeze I can get.
- [Knix Period Underwear](https://www.knixteen.ca/collections/teen-period-underwear/products/everyday-leakproof-kit) (**Kept from last year**) used to be my go-to, in case I had random spotting from my birth control, but I went off my birth control and now pretty much when my period comes (not during the trip). I probably should have just switched these for something else quick-dry - the pad area is annoying to handwash and dries the slowest compared to the rest. I bought the period pack for teens from their KnixTeen site, since it was a bit cheaper, especially when buying in bulk. I bring a total of 2 pairs, including the one I'm wearing.
- [Vessi Everyday Move](https://ca.vessi.com/products/womens-everyday-move-breezy-black-on-black) (**Kept from last year**) was my "one-shoe", but I probably should have gone for something lighter and more breathable since the forecast for Vegas seems to be mostly dry, but I didn't have another pair of shoes in rotation and this pair had my new orthotics I got this year. I did notice a ton of random puddles in Vegas I did feel some reassurance on my pick. HOWEVER, they didn't feel as comfortable this year and I just got back from a 15km walk and I'm nursing a giant blister on my sole, plus I was really feeling that pavement in every step. I'll probably switch this out for my next trip, but I think about how I was able to walk 20-40k steps during my grad trip 5 years ago in a pair of random $20 sneakers and a brand new (unbroken-in) pair of sandals with no discomfort...
- [Puma Women's Athletic Sock](https://www.costco.ca/puma-women's-athletic-sock%2C-12-pack.product.100669418.html) (**Kept from last year**) are the old-reliable from Costco. They aren't anything special, but I've had some pairs for a few years now and I haven't worn a hole in them yet. I bring a total of 2 pairs, including the pair I'm wearing. I'm going to look into merino wool socks because these are also kind of annoying to handwash, takes a while to dry and smell :(.
- [Water repellent SPF 50 hat](https://sportaboutequipment.com/products/richardson-outdoor-r-active-lite-outdoor-cap-155) (**Kept from last year, different object tho**) is different from last year's hat, but has the same function. I figured I'd feel less bad if I lost the hat that I last saw selling for $5 for a 2-pack from Costco, versus the hat I spent $25 AMERICAN dollars on at a place I'm unlikely to visit again anytime soon (~~Facebook~~ Meta campus).
- Glasses (**Kept from last year, different object tho**), because I don't want to waste a pair of contacts for just sitting in the airport and falling asleep on the plane. If I had monthlies I'd wear those, since it helps reduce mask fogging. Unfortunately my new glasses/ prescription falls off my face and fogs up more easily, but gives me better vision.
- KN95 mask (**Kept from last year, different object tho**), mostly because a lot of people are highkey gross and somehow manage to be worse in the airport. I feel vindicated about this despite masking being less of a thing nowadays, because there were multiple people hacking disgusting wet coughs on the plane. I only saw maybe 2 other people masking, and they seemed healthy, so I needed all the protection I can get.

## In the main bag

- 13 inch 2020 Macbook Pro - something for me to be able to do Leetcode, apply for jobs, respond to recruiters and research things to do for this trip. I've been in interview/ job-prep mode since I got laid off right after we booked the trip and didn't have time to do more trip research earlier other than playing videos of people eating at buffets in the background while studying. There's a dedicated internal compartment but it's not padded and due to the placement of the packable pocket, it takes some effort to take it out for security at the airport.
- AliExpress packing cubes (**Kept from last year**)  - sold by many different stores, in many colour options. I usually only use the two smallest cubes and the medium pouch. The zippers are flimsy and there's not compression straps but it's a cheap and good enough organizer. I considered getting compression cubes (I had this whole [hypothetical thread on vacuum sealing stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/12g35w0/vacuumsealing_hack_yay_or_nay/) lol)
- [Birkenstock EVA Arizona](https://www.birkenstock.com/us/arizona-essentials/arizona-eva-eva-0-eva-u_3720.html) (**new**) Last year I tried flipflops and I hated it, so back to Birks I go. I hate how much space they take up since the straps do not fold flat without permanent creasing, but I don't have another sandal I like as much. These work as hotel slippers, pool slides, and even for outings if I need my toes to breathe. I've been on the hunt for the one-sandal and found one likely candidate except it went out of production 10 years ago. These go into a plastic bag and then into the front open pocket.
- RADISHES for airplane snacking, but also to prevent myself from packing too much other crap. Once the RADISHES are consumed it frees up a decent amount of room, plus the plastic bagel bag can be reused in a pinch. Last year I packed bagels and Reddit loved the idea, but were worried about my health (and waistline). This year I had a bag of radishes from Costco I needed to use up before we left, so into the bag they went. Spoiler: they are spicy if you eat too many of them, and cannot travel internationally. Thankfully I had a domestic layover, so I was able to finish them before I went thru American customs.
- In the various side and internal pockets I have Clorox wipes, a pen, extra hair ties, a carabiner, cheap sunglasses I got from a career fair (thanks Google), and a foldable grocery bag (thanks Catit shopping event - partner took back his Chicobag).
- Liquid toiletries bag in the top internal pocket (that the packable sack packs into, when packed), once I'm through security.

## In the tech pouch

- Amazfit Zenbuds (bought off their Indiegogo/ Kickstarter) (**Kept from last year**). Not bad, cheaper than the Bose ones, app is adequate, helps deafen the sound of my partner snoring. A full charge lasts a bit more than a week, and it comes with multiple eartip size options.
- Anker 735 Charger (Nano II 65W) (**Kept from last year**) - this I got from AliExpress, but I think you can also get it from Amazon or their website. Two USB-C chargers plus USB-A, and the prongs at the end fold which is nice, no stabbing myself when digging around in my bag. I got it for around $50 CAD. Much better than carrying multiple chargers. One downside that has nothing to do with the charger itself is that the outlets at hotels and airports all seem to be loose, so this might fall out :(
- 10k mAh Power Bank (**Kept from last year**) - mine is an old one with no branding I got back in 2016 fro some warehouse sale. It's USB-A for charging so I need to bring a couple of duplicate cables :( but it feels wasteful to replace it when it otherwise works perfectly fine.
- Speaking of cables - I have USB-A to USB-C, USB-A to micro-usb (to charge the powerbank), and USB-C (for phone, Zenbuds and Macbook)
- Kobo Clara HD (**Kept from last year**) for travel day and rainy day entertainment. I have it hooked up with Overdrive and loaded with other ebooks, and I also use Pocket and have it sync the articles I've saved to read later. Images don't load great (e.g. with Pocket) but other than that, it's much better than endless scrolling a website. It did randomly freeze on me while I was on the plane after I switched from reading Pocket articles to trying to read a book I had previously started reading, so I might need to upgrade (I don't want to).
- Uma Hana coin purse (**Kept from last year**) - this one's a gift from a friend, I usually empty it of all but two of my credit cards, one debit card, driver's licence and health card. I also tossed in all $263USD I had. The material is waterproof but the zippers most definitely are not.
- Water bottle strap (**Kept from last year**) - worked fairly well last year. I got this off AliExpress, and it hooks onto the neck of those disposable plastic bottles. Rather than lugging around my own bottle, I can buy a bottled water, refill it during the trip and then throw it out before returning. I actually ended up getting a really nice metal reusable bottle complimentary of the hotel (the perks of tagging along on a conference trip and a partner having status at a nice hotel!!) but the neck was too wide, so I ended up buying a Smart Water with the sports cap.
- Small container of painkillers (ibuprofen, acetaminophen) (**Kept from last year, new location**) - I used to have it in the main bag but having it here makes it easier to access while I'm on the move. I'm reusing the toy container from a Kinder Surprise, which I know the Americans don't have.
- Phone and passport (of course) (**Kept from last year**). I know y'all were telling me to get a new phone last year but I wanted to wait for the Pixel 8 or the new Xiaomi maybe (I wanted a small phone and headphone jack and was really into the new Zenfone 10 until I found out about its support... 2 years?????) My phone decided to give me a reason to replace it as soon as I'm back in Canada though - it randomly turned off while I was alone in downtown Vegas and would restart and then immediately go black-screen :) So I'll actually get a new one this year, if anyone has more updated recommendations!

This year, I also have a liquids pouch since I'm packing sunscreen. It stays in the tech pouch until after I make it thru security, to make it easier to take out compared to if I tossed it in my backpack.

- Nivea SPF60 sunscreen (**new**) - turns out I hated the sunscreen stick because it smelled unpleasant and didn't apply as well. Also, I bought a 4pack of this sunscreen from Costco and then proceeded to not leave my house, so I need to use this up before it expires. Both my partner and I will be using this so I'm hoping to be able to finish both tubes and not have to schlep them back. They're 88mL so they fall under the liquid constraints.
- Hand sanitizer (Bath and Body Works)(**Kept from last year but slightly different**) - went with the regular liquid over the spray since the spray took up a lot of room.
- Travel sized toothpaste from the dentist
- Antiperspirant (Gillette brand from Costco)
- Mascara (Covergirl Lashblast Volume Waterproof), which I mostly use for brows instead lol


## Medium packing cube (clothes)

Still mostly Old Navy stuff, just not activewear this time. I took a break from the gym due to some injuries earlier this year, and then got sidetracked with the whole job hunt thing, so I don't plan on doing any dedicated workouts this trip and therefore don't have to ensure my clothes can do double duty. I love the concept of linen for keeping cool, but if you have thick thighs like me, be warned that you might find that they pill aggressively between the legs. 

Usually with Old Navy, you can wait for things to go on sale and stack with their email signup code. Sometimes they'll have random items on deeper discount. I tried to include the exact colours of items I'm packing in the image to give a better sense of how things look together, but some were unavailable when I went to get images. I aimed to keep everything in mostly the same-ish colour scheme with some monochromatic looks - terracotta, bright mustard and beige - my sunglasses are actually the same colour as the dress and my shoes are kinda beige. It's mostly bottoms since I anticipate getting a tshirt or two while I'm here.

I told myself last year that I'd lose weight so I can save some space by having smaller clothes (did not happen). But since temps are high 20s/ low 30s and not 10s - 20s, I was still able to save a ton of space. For the trip over, I was able to pack the small packing cube into the medium packing cube.

### Tops

Still taking recommendations for good travel bras for larger cup sizes! Things that pack well, are comfy and supportive and wash/ dry up well when needed.

- Joe Fresh high neck cropped bra top (no longer available) (**new**) - also picked mostly for the colour matching everything else I had. I like tops with these built-in since I have yet to find a bra I like for travel.
- Random oversized tech tshirt (**new**) - if I do work out on the first few days, before I obtain a souvenir shirt. Also doubles as a nightshirt - I failed to account for that last year and ended up having to sleep topless which was not the vibe :/
- [Fit & Flare Tie-Strap Linen-Blend Mini Dress for Women](https://oldnavy.gapcanada.ca/browse/product.do?pid=559677013&vid=1&&searchText=linen%20dress#pdp-page-content) (**new**) replaces the exercise dress I had last year. Turns out having to strip half naked in the bathroom stall was also not the vibe. This dress has pockets which is always useful, and the back stretchy panel is supportive enough of my chest that I don't have to wear a bra with it. There are some models of this dress on the Old Navy website that have a liner, but this one doesn't so it packs down better and you actually get the benefits of the linen material.

### Bottoms

Longer shorts = chub rub prevention. Shorter shorts require me to lube up my inner thighs with deodorant which works great to prevent chub rub. They might have the issue of getting gobbled up in the crotch area depending on how your legs are.

- [Old Navy High-Waisted PowerSoft Loose Shorts for Women -- 3-inch inseam](https://oldnavy.gapcanada.ca/browse/product.do?pid=807536053&vid=1&nav=meganav%3AWomen%3AOld+Navy+Active%3AShop+All+Activewear+&autosuggest=true&searchText=powersoft+shorts&position=2&results=6#pdp-page-content) (**Kept from last year**)  great for a more casual option or if I decide to hit the gym (unlikely). I brought these because I had a pair in the same colour as my travel day pants and the linen shorts.
- [High-Waisted Linen-Blend Utility Shorts for Women -- 3.5-inch inseam](https://oldnavy.gapcanada.ca/browse/product.do?pid=563336023&vid=1&&searchText=linen%20shorts#pdp-page-content)(**new**)
- [Linen-Blend Jogger Shorts for Men -- 7-inch inseam](https://oldnavy.gapcanada.ca/browse/product.do?pid=853507013&vid=1&&searchText=linen%20shorts#pdp-page-content) (**new**) I have these in beige, and despite being from the men's section, they fit fairly well. Nice pockets and drawstring waist, doesn't ride up in the crotch and no chub rub. They are more of an acquired look


## Small packing cube (underclothing)

- [Puma Women’s Sports Bra](https://www.costco.ca/puma-women%E2%80%99s-sports-bras%2C-3-pack.product.100985471.html) (**new**) x1 for when I do need to work out/ wear a shirt without a built-in bra
- [Puma Women's Athletic Sock](https://www.costco.ca/puma-women's-athletic-sock%2C-12-pack.product.100669418.html) (**new**) (**Kept from last year**) x1
- [KnixTeen Leakproof Underwear](https://www.knixteen.ca/collections/teen-period-underwear/products/everyday-leakproof-kit) (**Kept from last year**) x1
- Joe Fresh Square Neck Bikini Top (no longer available online) (**Kept from last year**), decently supportive, clasps in the back. Purchased for half-off, ~$16.
- Random highwaisted swim bottom (**new**) - I didn't like the board shorts I took last year so it's back to bikini bottoms.

Instead of using a medium pouch like I did last year, these now just live in the small packing cube with the other clothes. All **Kept from last year**.

- Contacts (8 pairs of dailies - 6 for the full days and 2 just in case)
- Tweezers
- Razor handle + blade (Edge brand from Costco)
- Sonic toothbrush (Phillips Sonicare Diamond), with brush head and cap, fully charged before the trip
- Detangling hairbrush - I got this one from Miniso and it comes with a lid to protect the bristles. It worked really well last trip!
- Solid shampoo bar (from AliExpress, surprisingly good). I tried a different shampoo bar but it was soap and not synthdet and my hair HATED it, so I'll stick to this shampoo bar. However, the hotel I'm at has some nice-smelling shampoo and conditioner so I could've gotten away with not packing this.
- Mesh soap bag for the solid shampoo. Can use soap directly through the mesh bag, and then hang to dry. Last year I had two since I also packed laundry soap my mom gave me, but I didn't like the smell of that and figured I'll just use the soap we always get in hotels.
- Extra Ziploc bag (usually throw the smaller items in that one so they're easier to find, but also for the soap in case I need to travel with them still wet)

## EDC use of the tech pouch

After I get to the hotel, I usually end up plugging in most of my tech stuff so I have this pouch emptied. Generally on a full day out, I bring
- Water bottle
- Water bottle strap
- Sunscreen
- Packable shopping bag
- Phone
- Wallet/ coin purse
- Carabiner
- Extra masks
- Power bank
- USB-A/ USB-C cable
- Sunglasses
- Extra hair tie
- Painkillers
- Disinfectant wipes
- Hand sanitizer
