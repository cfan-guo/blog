description: Incredibly original title, but a first should be acknowledged. Gotta make some good on the goal I set myself for 2022.
tldr: By setting this up and publishing this post, I can check "starting a blog" off the list.

Alright, we're 9 months into the year and it's time to take a look at the goals I've set for myself, according to my [GitHub README](https://github.com/cfan-guo).

> ### üöÄ &nbsp; Goals for 2022
> - [ ] üí™ &nbsp; Hit a one plate bench
> - [x] üçÖ &nbsp; Harvest many tomatoes
> - [ ] üíû &nbsp; Train the cats to go for walks
> - [x] üë©‚Äçüç≥ &nbsp; Master one dish from each continent
> - [x] ‚úçÔ∏è &nbsp; Start a (non-tech) blog

Well, I
- got stuck at 115lbs for bench (year's not over yet!),
- harvested many cherry tomatoes along with a few beefsteak and early girls,
- nearly lost one of the cats when it freaked out and ripped off its harness... 
- cooked significantly less but still one dish from every continent (stay tuned for a future post),

and now we're at the blog part. I've been wanting to restart some sort of writing outlet for a while now that doesn't have an audience in mind (so no tumblr, no Facebook, no Twitter, no Medium, no AliExpress review, no Reddit), and isn't limited to a single theme. So that means onebagging and travel content, random product reviews, recipes and recipe reviews, maybe some ad-hoc workouts here and there. Maybe a tech ramble every once in a while, but admittedly most of my hobbies are offline.

I like this theme [(Archie)](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/archie/) for the most part but dang I really dislike the way it puts lists in a different font. Headers I understand, but lists? Time will tell if I stick with this theme or roll my own, or if I even stick with using Hugo. So far I'm a fan of being able to basically just... set it up and immediately start with content, because lord knows how long I'd spend writing code instead of writing posts otherwise. However, my main site is due for an upgrade and I was eyeing a move over to NextJS... but I do like not having to do anything special to be able to use Markdown. Plus I'm going to stick with using GitHub pages as long as I can, so something that works with it out of the box is pretty neat.

This is probably sufficient for a first post. Thanks for sticking around - the next few posts will be more interesting (they will be travel and onebag related, if that's your jam).
