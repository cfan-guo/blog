Here are some templates I set up during my last round of job searching, networking events and interviews. I am usually extremely avoidant of responding to messages because they make me anxious and the anxiety only worsens when I put them off. However, with a copy-and-pastable template, it makes it easier to do as routine rather than having to come up with a fresh response each time.

After all, if recruiters have tools to automate their process (LinkedIn will literally give me a modal to select if I'm interested or not, like 100% the recruiter didn't personally handwrite that message for me), why shouldn't I make things easier for myself too?

## The LinkedIn/ Email Response

As soon as you set your LinkedIn to "looking", as long as you're in an in-demand field, recruiters will swarm you like moths to a flame. If the role and company seem interesting, great, respond and let them know! If not, you can still be polite and decline. If they're a third party recruiter hired by multiple companies, they can forward you other roles as well. You never know where or when you'll run into them again during your job search.

Sometimes, even when you're not looking for another role, recruiters will reach out to you. I don't blame them, they have quotas to hit. If you're looking to expand your network, it's worthwhile to respond to them or send them a connection request, and reach out to them in the future. Or you could just ignore them if it's completely irrelevant both as a role and as a company.


When a recruiter slides into your DMs...

**and you're interested or looking:**
> Hi [NAME], thanks for reaching out! I'd love to learn more about [COMPANY] and the role! Do you have a calendar link for me to schedule some time for a call?

**and you're looking and the company seems interesting, but the role isn't:**
> Hi [NAME], thanks for reaching out! I'm actually looking for more of a [type of role you're looking for], does [COMPANY] have any available?

**and you're not looking, but the opportunity seems interesting:**
> Hi [NAME], thanks for reaching out! I'm currently not looking for a new role, but I'd love to stay in touch!

plus some variation or combination of
> I would be interested in learning more in the future. Would [X] months from now work?
>
> I've sent you a connection request on LinkedIn.

depending on your timeline and when you expect to be looking for your next role.

If you do know someone who is looking, it's good karma and relationship-building to forward their contact information to the recruiter *with their consent*. Your friend will probably appreciate you thinking of them, and the recruiter will probably appreciate the extra lead. In that case, you can update the message to something like:

> Hi [NAME], thanks for reaching out! I'm currently not looking for a new role, but I know someone from [your relationship to them] who might be interested. I can connect you with them.

Only do this after letting the person know you're sending a recruiter their way!

Once you've filled out the templates in a way that's relevant to what you're looking for, save them somewhere, set aside 15 minutes every morning (if you're actively looking, or once a week if you're not) and mass respond.

## The 30s Elevator Pitch

The 30s elevator pitch, so-called for its duration being roughly the amount of time you'd spend stuck in an elevator with someone, is a way to introduce yourself and make a connection with someone. Having a blurb memorized is great for not having to think too hard when making introductions in an interview, or talking to someone at a career fair or networking event.

I too love palindromes.")

The "elevator pitch" template here is geared more towards an interview or talking to a rep at a booth for a company you're interested in working for, at a career fair.

> Hi, I'm [NAME]! I'm currently a [CURRENT ROLE] working at [CURRENT COMPANY], mainly working with [YOUR MAIN TOOLS and/or TECH STACK].
>
> [1-2 sentences on any previous roles and experiences related to your goals and what you're looking for at your next role]
>
> I am looking for a role that is [DESCRIPTION OF IDEAL ROLE], and have heard great things about [COMPANY NAME]. I'm excited to learn more about the culture, the challenges and rewards of working there.

I personally think that the upper limit would be closer to a minute than 30 seconds. Time yourself reading your pitch at a normal, conversational speed.

An example would be something like

> Hi, I'm Fan! I'm currently a software engineer at Properly, a Canadian proptech startup. My current stack is React (NextJS) and Python, but I also have experience with Ruby on Rails, and have worked on both internal and customer-facing applications.
>
> Previously, I worked at Gobble as a senior software engineer, Connected as a software engineer, team lead and engineering manager, and Flipp as a software engineer. I highly value working at a product company and going beyond just coding, in order to truly "own" projects and processes.
>
> For my next role, I am looking for something that allows me to continue to develop and demonstrate my passion for product-thinking, technical excellence, leadership and autonomy. I have heard great things about [COMPANY] and I'm excited to learn more about the culture, challenges and rewards of working there.
