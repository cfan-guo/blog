Focus on consistency and building habits over outcomes. Replace scrolling with doing!!!</div><section class=body><p>I <a href=/posts/my-first-post>wrote</a> about checking off goals earlier this year:</p><blockquote><h3 id=-nbsp-goals-for-2022>üöÄ ¬† Goals for 2022</h3><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> üí™ ¬† Hit a one plate bench</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> üçÖ ¬† Harvest many tomatoes</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> üíû ¬† Train the cats to go for walks</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> üë©‚Äçüç≥ ¬† Master one dish from each continent</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> ‚úçÔ∏è ¬† Start a (non-tech) blog</li></ul></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, we found out the hard way that the Nacho cat hates the outdoors even more than the Taco cat, so they will remain indoors and unwalked. A better goal would probably have been to play more with them. Nacho still doesn&rsquo;t know what a cat toy is and shows no interest in play, which is kind of sad if you think about it.</p><p><img src=/posts/img/2023-Taco-Nacho.jpeg alt="Taco (grey cat) and Nacho (orange and cream cat) sitting on the bed, looking curiously at the camera"></p><p>Here are the two little monsters.</p><p>As for bench - I switched my routine a couple of times this year between strength and hypertrophy, which I&rsquo;ll maybe eventually dedicate an entire post to.</p><p>And with no preamble whatsoever, here are the</p><h2 id=goals-ive-set-for-myself-for-2023>Goals I&rsquo;ve set for myself for 2023</h2><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> 3 plate squat and deadlift???</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Be able to run at least 10k</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Harvest many tomatoes, peppers and potatoes</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Learn to crochet</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Meal prep at least once a month</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Add blog content at least once a month</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Add daily yoga, meditation and walking sessions</li></ul><p>Some of these are numbers to work towards, but I&rsquo;m not going to beat myself up if I&rsquo;m not giving 110% and crushing it every single day in a single-minded mission to attain them. I think that&rsquo;s unrealistic and a one-way express ticket to burning out, becoming discouraged and quitting permanently. Rather, those numbers are (mostly) reasonable goals and can actually be accomplished if I put in beyond the absolute bare minimum effort. Bringing us to the next part:</p><h2 id=rationale>Rationale</h2><p>The theme for 2023 is <strong>consistency</strong>.</p><p>I want to</p><ul><li>keep doing some of the things I&rsquo;m already doing,</li><li>do more of some things I do, but not as regularly as I would like, and</li><li>try something new and hopefully develop a habit for them.</li></ul><p>I have an unhealthy fixation with time: not having enough time, not spending my time correctly, not doing things at the right time, and then doing nothing but scrolling on my phone for hours because I reason that I don&rsquo;t have enough quality time to really get into what I want to do. I&rsquo;ve been living vicariously through other people&rsquo;s Stories and Reels and TikToks, making excuses for myself like &ldquo;oh that takes too long to learn&rdquo; or &ldquo;that costs so much money to try&rdquo; and &ldquo;what if I don&rsquo;t like it&rdquo;.</p><p>Well, the time will pass anyways, better an actor than always the passive observer. If I can plan my time better, or be less attached with the idea of doing things only at the perfect time, I will have something to show for it at the end of the year.</p><h3 id=some-existing-habits>Some existing habits:</h3><ul><li>Working out (weightlifting)</li></ul><p>For the most part, I&rsquo;ve been pretty consistent with this. I aim to do at least 3 quality workouts a week. This year, I found that when I switched from a 3-day plan to a 4-day plan (which I could have done instead as alternating days i.e. 3x-4x a week), my intention of MT-TF workout days would become M-W-TF or MT&ndash;FS, and I would have a lot of anxiety with completing my workouts for the week. If I got too off track early on, it would discourage me from doing the rest of the scheduled workouts for the week. Finding a better schedule and being more flexible with my routine would help a lot. If I didn&rsquo;t have the time for an 1.5h workout, I can just do something quick and move my routine over a day, rather than becoming obsessive with having to do workout A on Monday, workout B on Tuesday etc and declaring it a failure if I don&rsquo;t follow it to the letter.</p><p>Moving my body is a privilege, not a burden, and it should improve my life rather than adding its own set of anxiety. Progress might be slower than if I only stuck to a routine, but I&rsquo;ll take progress over procrastination.</p><h3 id=some-inconsistent-habits>Some inconsistent habits:</h3><ul><li>Meal prep</li><li>Writing posts</li><li>Mindfulness and yoga</li><li>Walking</li><li>Cleaning</li></ul><p>I usually try to meal prep a few times a month, but sometimes I have a busy weekend of doing non-cooking related things and then I&rsquo;m scrambling for food all week. This has meant airfrying freezer food, which is not the healthiest. Instead, I&rsquo;m going to aim for Sundays and (no-meeting) Wednesdays as my prep days as needed, and Saturday as my grocery day.</p><p>Writing posts - I&rsquo;m currently working on it! I have a content &ldquo;plan&rdquo; and many half-finished and just-started drafts, but have not set myself proper deadlines. I am going to aim for a post every month, since I want to limit my screen time and working an office job means 8+ hours of staring at a screen during the day and I&mldr; need a break. Maybe 10 minutes every morning to just freeform, and editing once a week? That should be reasonable.</p><p>Yoga and mindfulness are two things I want to do more of this year. I find myself lost after doing 30 days of guided, introductory sessions, and then stop. I also forced myself to do them even when I don&rsquo;t want to during those 30 days, so I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s some resentment and &ldquo;going through the motions&rdquo;. Acknowledging that is a first step, actually doing something is the next. If I &ldquo;go through the motions&rdquo; enough, eventually the consistency will win out. Sometimes the things you enjoy will feel like a chore, but you&rsquo;ll be thankful for following through on them.</p><p>Walking is one of those things I enjoy doing, but don&rsquo;t do as often as I should because who wants to put on a bra and outside clothes? Even walking on the treadmill requires that I put on socks or something, which feels like a waste because I need to do extra sock-based laundry for 30 minutes of walking. This can probably be tied into another unwritten goal I have, which is to dress more put-together, even for WFH. This way, I don&rsquo;t have to justify putting on different clothes for an hour walk when I&rsquo;m already dressed for the day&mldr; and I&rsquo;m not above wearing sweats outside.</p><p>Cleaning is something I struggle with. I can&rsquo;t focus or do anything unless my surroundings are clean, or at least cleared. Bake cookies? Gotta clear the kitchen first but it&rsquo;s too much effort to clean and I don&rsquo;t have enough time to clean and bake&mldr; so I end up not doing the baking part. Ditto for creative stuff I need desk space to do. Set aside time every week to clean, and do things that take less than 2 minutes immediately, rather than putting it off indefinitely. Immediately > indefinitely, catchy I know.</p><h3 id=some-new-habits-and-hobbies-i-want-to-develop>Some new habits and hobbies I want to develop:</h3><ul><li>Crochet</li><li>Running/ cardio based activities</li></ul><p>I want to to make cute things and not die in the case of a zombie apocalypse, simple as that.</p><h3 id=some-seasonal-activities-i-want-to-be-more-present-for>Some seasonal activities I want to be more present for:</h3><ul><li>Running (outdoors)</li><li>Gardening</li></ul><p>Running outdoors combines two of my least favourite things - running, and the mortifying ordeal of being perceived. I&rsquo;m hoping being outside of my comfort zone for this will translate into personality improvements elsewhere.</p><p>I bought cool new seeds that weren&rsquo;t the 3 for a dollar ones from Dollarama, so now I&rsquo;m invested in getting beautiful non-red tomatoes, spicy peppers and colourful potatoes. It seems like it would be so peaceful to spend mornings puttering around a garden, and would be a great mood-booster. At least that&rsquo;s the hope. Maybe I should have set my goal as being able to wake up before 9am.</p><h2 id=vision-board>Vision Board</h2><p><img src=/posts/img/2023-Vision-Board.png alt="Vision board for 2023, alt text in next section"></p><p>This section doubles as the image-alt:</p><p>Images in the vision board were copied straight from Google Image Search, with something from every part of the goals. A gym, a smiling girl who&rsquo;s running, two cyclists on the Rouge Waterfront Trail, which I&rsquo;ve only ever seen from the GO Train. Cute crochet things I want to eventually be able to make - cloud cardigans and little stuffed animals. A bountiful rainbow of tomatoes from a picture perfect garden. A beautifully staged room with soft lighting and two well behaved cats, a neat and aesthetic desk where everything has its place, and a cup of tea and a paperback (even though I mostly read on an ereader these days). Food at a night market in China, which I hope to visit again soon, and a week&rsquo;s worth of food stored in neat glass containers. There&rsquo;s Yoga with Adriene, which I followed religiously for a month this January before immediately dropping.</p><p>I did the same with the 30 days of meditation thing on Calm as well - as soon as the last day was over, I forgot the app existed, oops!</p><p>(End of image alt doubling part)</p><p>I want to spend 2023 being more intentional with my time, and where I direct my efforts.</p><p>Instead of spending downtime on my phone, I could read a book, or one of the articles I&rsquo;ve Pocketed for myself weeks ago, or crochet the cats a little hat. I want to leave my house more often during the day, rather than cooping myself indoors 6/7 days of the week and only emerging to replenish groceries. Maybe I could have grown better tomatoes if I properly staked them and pruned them, rather than transplanting them outside and then disappearing for a month while I waited for fruit to appear. I would like to enjoy spending time in the garden. I would like to enjoy spending time with myself, being present for hobbies, my cats and my partner. I want to be strong and lift heavy things, but also not lose my breath (or my mind) running for an hour. I want to be able to keep up, and keep going.</p><p>I want to make 2022 me proud of what I can accomplish, and 2024 me thankful for the foundation I&rsquo;ve built.</p><p>2023, let&rsquo;s do this!</p></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/goals>goals</a></li><li><a href=/tags/new-year>new year</a></li></ul></nav></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex><a class=soc href=https://github.com/cfan-guo title=GitHub><i data-feather=github></i></a>
