I&rsquo;ll have an update on how that list worked for me sometime in the future.</em></p><div class=callout><div class=callout-inner>💡 I started writing out the entire 10 day travel plan (with commentary) as a single post, except it got really long and I was getting antsy. So like we say a lot in software development... ship early, ship often. I'll start with a very barebones overview for each day, and then slowly trickle out the more detailed commentary for each day, and update this post with links as I publish.</div></div><p>When we mentioned that we were heading to PEI for 10 days, everyone remarked that 10 days is a lot of time to spend in PEI. I don&rsquo;t know if they were just bad at finding things to do, but we found that 10 days was If you plan on exploring the entire island, you must rent a car. There&rsquo;s transit (bus) in Charlottetown but that&rsquo;s about it. Also, book at least two months in advance. When I checked the PEI subreddit, locals were warning tourists that car rentals might be scarce if you wait until the last minute.</p><h3 id=traveling-in-the-off-season>Traveling in the &ldquo;off season&rdquo;</h3><p>PEI has a distinct tourist season - June to the first Monday of September. In September, a lot of the most touristy, outside-of-Charlottetown things close after Labour Day. However not all the Google locations reflected those seasonal closures right away. If you&rsquo;re traveling outside of Charlottetown for the full day, call ahead to a few restaurants in the area, or just pack a meal and snacks. Despite checking websites in advance, we were misled to think that some of the boardwalks (Mariner&rsquo;s Cove) would still be open albeit with reduced hours, but they were actually closed. Some may be partially open, with a reduced number of shops and restaurants available with the rest closed for the season. We figured what with the Shellfish Festival and the Fall Flavours Culinary Festival both happening in September that more would be open, but sadly that was not the case.</p><h3 id=planning-the-trip>Planning the trip</h3><p>First, determine what your interests are - food, water sports, bike tours, fishing, hiking and camping, farms, museums, golf, arts and threatre, brewery and winery tours&mldr; the list goes on. I had a few primary &ldquo;MUST-DO"s on <em>my</em> list: eat lobster, eat potatoes, buy cool local soaps, and check out Anne of Green Gables stuff. Secondary &ldquo;cool if I do, fine if I don&rsquo;t&rdquo; were unique museums, hikes, winery and brewery tours, window shopping and checking out lighthouses. My partner only cared about eating lobster, so no compromises were needed!</p><p>We started planning our trip early, and preregistered for a couple of events. The locations of those events determined what we were doing that day. Our Downtown trips were determined by when there was free parking (after 6pm on weekdays and all the time on weekends), though there are a few parkades around the area and the prices are extremely reasonable, compared to Downtown Toronto. The downtown is fairly small and walkable, so two full day trips gave us plenty of time to hit up the small shops, try out different restaurants, and attend a few scheduled events.</p><p>Additionally, I am obsessed with the idea of farmers markets, and unfortunately most of the ones where I live are on a weekday&mldr; when I&rsquo;m working. So I used this trip as a chance to check out some farmers markets, which often featured crafts, jewelery, knitwear and homemade natural skincare and candles in addition to fresh produce, honey, preserves and jerky and other foods.</p><p>So if you&rsquo;re also into Farmer&rsquo;s Markets, these are the days they&rsquo;re open (usually May/June - September).</p><blockquote><ul><li>Saturday:<ul><li><a href=https://charlottetownfarmersmarket.com/>Charlottetown Farmers Market</a></li><li><a href=https://summersidefarmersmarket.com/>Summerside Farmers Market</a></li><li><a href=https://www.facebook.com/sourisfarmersmarket/>Souris Farmers Market</a></li></ul></li><li>Sunday:<ul><li><a href=https://downtowncharlottetownmarket.com/>Downtown Charlottetown Farmers Market</a></li><li><a href=https://www.facebook.com/charlottetownfleamarket/>Charlottetown Flea Market</a></li></ul></li><li>Wednesday:<ul><li><a href=https://charlottetownfarmersmarket.com/>Charlottetown Farmers Market (fewer vendors)</a></li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><p>We stayed at the Hampton by Hilton for the entirety of the trip, which was near a shopping plaza in one diretion and the big COWS Creamery in the other, north of Charlottetown. This gave us a few meal options when we failed to find an open restaurant on our day trip, but didn&rsquo;t want to go all the way to Downtown Charlottetown for a sitdown meal (fast food and TV in the hotel FTW!) Because I wanted to be able to workout without having to find a local gym, I opted for a chain hotel rather than one of those boutique places every travel person raves about&mldr; also because I didn&rsquo;t have 5k to drop on just the hotel for 10 days.</p><h2 id=10-day-itinerary>10 day itinerary</h2><p>Legend:</p><blockquote><p>🦞 Lobster 🥔 Potato 🛍️ Shopping 😋 Food 📸 Scenic🍦 Ice cream 🏛️ Museum 🧼 Soap 🐐 Farm animals 🍷 Alcohol</p></blockquote><h3 id=travel-day>Travel Day</h3><blockquote><ul><li>Pick up rental car and check into hotel</li><li>Grab a meal downtown (free parking after 6pm), we went to <a href=https://www.rowhouselobster.ca/>Row House Lobster Co.</a> 🦞</li></ul></blockquote><h3 id=anne-of-green-gables-and-cavendish-day>Anne of Green Gables and Cavendish Day</h3><blockquote><ul><li><a href=https://lmmontgomerybirthplace.ca/>Birthplace of LMM Montgomery</a> 🏛️</li><li><a href=https://www.annemuseum.com/index.php>Anne of Green Gables Museum and Store</a> 🏛️🧼</li><li><a href=https://goo.gl/maps/dUaCr8T8reQgktap8>Hostetter&rsquo;s Viewscape</a> 📸</li><li><a href=https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/lhn-nhs/pe/greengables/activ/centre>Green Gables Visitor Center and Heritage Place</a> (Anne of Green Gables House + forest walks) 🏛️</li><li><a href=https://goo.gl/maps/bd7MkYtdxj2zAGvk6>Cavendish Heritage Park/ Montgomery Park</a> 📸</li><li><a href=https://www.lmmontgomerycavendishhome.com/>The Site of Lucy Maud Montgomery&rsquo;s Cavendish Home</a> 🏛️</li><li><a href=https://goo.gl/maps/CzpxSpC4MDTvuMPT7>LMM Cemetery (Cavendish Community Cemetery)</a> 📸</li><li><a href=http://cavendishboardwalk.com/>Cavendish Beach Boardwalk</a> (some places open) 🛍️😋</li><li><a href=https://www.maritimefun.com/marinerscove/>Mariner&rsquo;s Cove Boardwalk</a> (closes Labour Day) 🛍️😋</li><li><a href=http://www.avonlea.ca/>Avonlea Village</a> (mostly closed after Labour Day except for Anne of Green Gables Chocolates and one of the restaurants) 🛍️😋</li></ul></blockquote><h3 id=souris-day-lobster-lovers>Souris Day (Lobster Lovers)</h3><blockquote><ul><li><a href=https://fiddlingfisherman.com/experiences/lobster-lovers/>Lobster Lovers with the Fiddling Fisherman</a> (booked in advance) 🦞😋</li><li><a href=https://www.facebook.com/TheLobsterShackOnSourisBeach/>Lobster Shack</a> 🦞😋</li><li><a href=https://www.facebook.com/people/The-Pok%C3%A9-Shack/100063636309771/>Poké Shack</a> 😋</li><li><a href=https://www.facebook.com/BasinHeadFisheriesMuseum/>Basin Head Fisheries Museum</a> 🏛️</li><li><a href=https://pointseastcoastaldrive.com/things-to-do/entry/souris-beach-gateway-park>Souris Beach Gateway Park</a> (red sands beach and boardwalk) 📸</li><li><a href=https://www.shai.ca/harbour-authority/historic-lighthouse/>Souris Historic Lighthouse</a> 📸</li><li><a href=https://www.facebook.com/sourisfarmersmarket/>Souris Farmers Market</a> 🛍️</li><li><a href=https://www.artisansonmainsouris.com/>Artisans on Main</a> 🛍️</li><li><a href=https://www.ohfudgepei.com/>Oh Fudge!</a> 🛍️</li><li><a href=https://sourisbytheseatreasures.com/>Souris by the Sea Treasures Gift Shop</a> 🛍️</li></ul></blockquote><h3 id=central-coastal-farm-day>Central Coastal Farm Day</h3><blockquote><ul><li><a href=https://www.islandhoneywine.ca/pages/farm-tours>Island Honey Wine Tour</a> (booked in advance) 🛍️🍷🧼📸</li><li><a href=https://www.tourismpei.com/search/OperatorDetails/name/CowsCreamery/op_id/5793/>COWS Creamery factory tour</a> (Milky Way location) 🛍️🍦</li><li><a href=https://www.facebook.com/tidewatersoapery/>The Soap Drawer</a> 🛍️🧼</li><li><a href=https://www.boomburger.ca/index.php>Boomburger</a> (Milky Way location) 😋</li><li><a href=https://www.receivercoffee.com/>Receiver Coffee</a> (Milky Way location) 😋</li><li><a href=https://www.farmerflory.com/>Island Hill Farm</a> (book bottle feedings in advance) 🐐🛍️🧼</li><li><a href=https://www.islandpotatosoap.com/>Island Potato Soap</a> 🛍️🥔🧼</li><li><a href=https://peilobstersuppers.com/>New Glasgow Lobster Suppers</a> (arrive early, ~4pm) 🦞😋</li></ul></blockquote><h3 id=farmers-market-day>Farmer&rsquo;s Market Day</h3><blockquote><ul><li><a href=https://downtowncharlottetownmarket.com/>Downtown Charlottetown Farmers Market</a> 🛍️😋🧼</li><li><a href=https://www.facebook.com/charlottetownfleamarket/>Charlottetown Flea Market</a> 🛍️😋🧼</li><li>Walk around downtown -
