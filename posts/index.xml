I have a picture of the side of my face at its worst posted in the comments.
tldr: The Blemish Buster and Eczema Cream resolved my sudden skin flareups that weren&amp;rsquo;t improving with my usual products. Acne and the worst of my new eczema disappeared in less than a week.
Product descriptions Both products are made locally in Ontario, with various butters, oils and essential oils.</description></item><item><title>Looking Ahead to 2023</title><link>https://blog.cfanguo.me/posts/looking-ahead-to-2023/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2022 20:49:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blog.cfanguo.me/posts/looking-ahead-to-2023/</guid><description>I wrote about checking off goals earlier this year:
🚀 Goals for 2022 💪 Hit a one plate bench 🍅 Harvest many tomatoes 💞 Train the cats to go for walks 👩‍🍳 Master one dish from each continent ✍️ Start a (non-tech) blog Unfortunately, we found out the hard way that the Nacho cat hates the outdoors even more than the Taco cat, so they will remain indoors and unwalked. A better goal would probably have been to play more with them.</description></item><item><title>PEI 10 Day Travel Guide</title><link>https://blog.cfanguo.me/posts/pei-10-day-overview/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Oct 2022 21:59:03 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.cfanguo.me/posts/pei-10-day-overview/</guid><description>Prelude For a 10 day packing list for September, check out this post. I&amp;rsquo;ll have an update on how that list worked for me sometime in the future.
💡 I started writing out the entire 10 day travel plan (with commentary) as a single post, except it got really long and I was getting antsy. So like we say a lot in software development... ship early, ship often. I&amp;#39;ll start with a very barebones overview for each day, and then slowly trickle out the more detailed commentary for each day, and update this post with links as I publish.</description></item><item><title>Networking and Interview Notes</title><link>https://blog.cfanguo.me/posts/networking-and-interview-notes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2022 20:58:30 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.cfanguo.me/posts/networking-and-interview-notes/</guid><description>Here are some templates I set up during my last round of job searching, networking events and interviews. I am usually extremely avoidant of responding to messages because they make me anxious and the anxiety only worsens when I put them off. However, with a copy-and-pastable template, it makes it easier to do as routine rather than having to come up with a fresh response each time.
After all, if recruiters have tools to automate their process (LinkedIn will literally give me a modal to select if I&amp;rsquo;m interested or not, like 100% the recruiter didn&amp;rsquo;t personally handwrite that message for me), why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t I make things easier for myself too?</description></item><item><title>Week of Workouts: PEI Hotel Edition</title><link>https://blog.cfanguo.me/posts/pei-hotel-workouts/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 21:18:21 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.cfanguo.me/posts/pei-hotel-workouts/</guid><description>One of the things I look forward to the most when I travel is access to a different gym. Since I do all of my workouts at home, and my home gym is mostly barbell based, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to just have the excuse and the equipment to do something different. The hotel we stayed at (Hampton by Hilton) had all the usual equipment - treadmills, elliptical, recumbent bike, cable machine, kettlebells, medicine balls, dumbbells - that I expect from a hotel gym, but also a stair climber (which I unfortunately couldn&amp;rsquo;t turn on&amp;hellip; I love stairs), and the dumbbells went up to a meaty 75lbs, rather than just the usual 50lbs.</description></item><item><title>10 Days in PEI Packing List</title><link>https://blog.cfanguo.me/posts/10-days-in-pei-packing-list/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Sep 2022 19:09:02 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.cfanguo.me/posts/10-days-in-pei-packing-list/</guid><description>This has been lightly edited from the original reddit post, which you can see here.
I first looked into the one-bag lifestyle during my grad trip, and I&amp;rsquo;m proud to say that I&amp;rsquo;ve come a ways since my 65L backpack (checked) onebag days. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty frugal, and the items certainly reflect that. Hopefully this can help anyone else who feels like they &amp;ldquo;can&amp;rsquo;t get into onebagging&amp;rdquo; because they can&amp;rsquo;t afford all the cool technical (expensive) items this sub talks about.</description></item><item><title>First</title><link>https://blog.cfanguo.me/posts/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2022 21:07:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.cfanguo.me/posts/my-first-post/</guid><description>Alright, we&amp;rsquo;re 9 months into the year and it&amp;rsquo;s time to take a look at the goals I&amp;rsquo;ve set for myself, according to my GitHub README.
