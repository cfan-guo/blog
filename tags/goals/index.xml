🚀 Goals for 2022 💪 Hit a one plate bench 🍅 Harvest many tomatoes 💞 Train the cats to go for walks 👩‍🍳 Master one dish from each continent ✍️ Start a (non-tech) blog Unfortunately, we found out the hard way that the Nacho cat hates the outdoors even more than the Taco cat, so they will remain indoors and unwalked. A better goal would probably have been to play more with them.</description></item></channel></rss>
