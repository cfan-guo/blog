I&amp;rsquo;ll have an update on how that list worked for me sometime in the future.
ðŸ’¡ I started writing out the entire 10 day travel plan (with commentary) as a single post, except it got really long and I was getting antsy. So like we say a lot in software development... ship early, ship often. I&amp;#39;ll start with a very barebones overview for each day, and then slowly trickle out the more detailed commentary for each day, and update this post with links as I publish.</description></item></channel></rss>
