I have a picture of the side of my face at its worst posted in the comments.
tldr: The Blemish Buster and Eczema Cream resolved my sudden skin flareups that weren&amp;rsquo;t improving with my usual products. Acne and the worst of my new eczema disappeared in less than a week.
Product descriptions Both products are made locally in Ontario, with various butters, oils and essential oils.</description></item></channel></rss>
