I first looked into the one-bag lifestyle during my grad trip, and I&amp;rsquo;m proud to say that I&amp;rsquo;ve come a ways since my 65L backpack (checked) onebag days. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty frugal, and the items certainly reflect that. Hopefully this can help anyone else who feels like they &amp;ldquo;can&amp;rsquo;t get into onebagging&amp;rdquo; because they can&amp;rsquo;t afford all the cool technical (expensive) items this sub talks about.</description></item></channel></rss>
