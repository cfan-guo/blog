Since I do all of my workouts at home, and my home gym is mostly barbell based, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to just have the excuse and the equipment to do something different. The hotel we stayed at (Hampton by Hilton) had all the usual equipment - treadmills, elliptical, recumbent bike, cable machine, kettlebells, medicine balls, dumbbells - that I expect from a hotel gym, but also a stair climber (which I unfortunately couldn&amp;rsquo;t turn on&amp;hellip; I love stairs), and the dumbbells went up to a meaty 75lbs, rather than just the usual 50lbs.</description></item></channel></rss>
